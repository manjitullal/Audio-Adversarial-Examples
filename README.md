# Audio-Adversarial-Examples

In this project we use build upon the adversarial audio attack
demonstrated by Carlini et al [9] on Speech to Text. Our contributions are summarized as follows.
•We study adversarial transferability of audio examples across machine learning space.
•Develop an algorithm to create universal adversarial perturbation for audio examples.

The project builds upon the below two code bases.
